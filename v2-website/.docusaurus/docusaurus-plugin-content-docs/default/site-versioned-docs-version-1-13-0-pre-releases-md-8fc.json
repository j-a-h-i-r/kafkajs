  "description": "Stable KafkaJS versions can take a while to be released. Release candidates are usually deployed in production for at least a week before general availability. We do this to make sure that all releases are stable, and we trust our services to verify most production use-cases. Although this process guarantees some quality, it can be too slow or unpredictable. Some versions go out faster than others, and it can be frustrating if you need a particular feature that has not been included in a stable release yet.",
